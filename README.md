# MyToken Solidity Smart Contract
* This is a simple Solidity smart contract for the MyToken token. The contract allows for minting and burning tokens, as well as querying the token balance for specific addresses.

## Contract Details
* Token Name: "anuj"
* Token Abbreviation: "Anuj1"
* Total Supply: 10,000

## License
* This smart contract is released under the MIT License. Please see the 'SPDX-License-Identifier' at the top of the contract for more details.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying and interacting with this smart contract, ensure that you have the following:

* A compatible Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, 
  Hardhat, etc.).
* A compatible Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to the desired 
  Ethereum network (e.g., Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc.).
* Sufficient funds in your Ethereum wallet to cover gas fees for 
  contract deployment and function execution.

## Contract Functions
1. 'mint(address _to, uint _value) public'
This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and allocate them to a specified address.

* Parameters:
   * '_to': The address to which the minted tokens will be allocated.
   * '_value': The number of tokens to mint and allocate.
2. 'burn(address _from, uint _value) public'
This function allows the contract owner to burn (destroy) a certain number of tokens held by a specific address.

* Parameters:
  * '_from': The address from which tokens will be burned.
  * '_value': The number of tokens to burn.

* Note: The burn function includes a require statement to check if the 
  specified address has a sufficient balance of tokens to be burned. If 
  the balance is not sufficient, 
  the transaction will revert with an "Insufficient balance" error.

3. balances(address) public view returns (uint)
This function allows anyone to query the token balance of a given address.

* Parameters:
  * address: The address for which the token balance will be retrieved.
  * Returns: The token balance of the specified address.

## Deployment
To deploy this smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler compatible with 
   version ^0.8.0.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to the desired Ethereum network using 
   your preferred Ethereum development environment.

## Interacting with the Contract
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the deployed contract address.

1. Use a wallet connected to the Ethereum network where the contract is 
   deployed.
2. Access the contract using the deployed contract address.
   Call the functions mint, burn, and balances with appropriate 
   parameters to perform token minting, burning, and querying, 
   respectively.

## Example:
Suppose the contract is deployed at address 0x123abc....

* To mint 100 tokens to address 0xAlice..., call the mint function with 
  parameters (0xAlice..., 100).
* To burn 50 tokens from address 0xAlice..., call the burn function with 
  parameters (0xAlice..., 50).
* To check the token balance of address 0xAlice..., call the balances 
  function with parameters (0xAlice...).
